## NOTE
Yes this is simple, yes this isn't totally the point in RoR, to host as an API only setup with a seperate front end. The point in this project is to learn Ruby and RoR in at least some sense as they are increasingly popular.

With some later projects, I will look at implementing a frontend with the RoR app, but my expertise lies with seperation right now. That is what I am comfortable with.
